# public_php
Some handy php classes &amp; functions I've written that I couldn't seem to find good equivalents for on the web.  Any modules that I've included that have a GPL need to be preserved intact.  The other files I've released under Lesser GPL which means you can use them in proprietary code.  Just follow the guidelines on the gnu site!

This code wasn't designed to be released as a public library, so the documentation is a bit sparse.  If you'd like to edit the file(s) and check them back into the depot, just send me your login info and I'd be happy to have you submit any fixes/enhancements you make!

Enjoy!
