# public_php
Some handy php classes &amp; functions I've written that I couldn't seem to find good equivalents for on the web.  Any modules that I've included that have a GPL need to be preserved intact.  The other files I've released under Lesser GPL which means you can use them in proprietary code.  Just follow the guidelines on the gnu site! Enjoy!
